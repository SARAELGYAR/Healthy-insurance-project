Problem Statement

Health insurance systems often face several challenges, including inefficient claim processing, lack of transparency in policy details, and overall user dissatisfaction due to poor system design and performance. These issues not only frustrate end-users but also increase operational overhead for insurance providers. This project aims to define and document clear software requirements for a digital health insurance management solution that addresses these challenges. The focus is on creating a system that enhances clarity, improves efficiency in claims handling, and ensures scalability to accommodate future growth and updates.

Project Scope

The primary goal of this project is to develop comprehensive requirements for a robust Health Insurance Management System. This system will provide a seamless user experience and facilitate the following key functionalities:

Claim submission and tracking: Simplifying the process of submitting and monitoring claims with real-time updates and status notifications.
Policy selection, purchase, and management: Offering users an intuitive interface to browse, compare, purchase, and manage their health insurance policies efficiently.
Notifications for renewals, approvals, and updates: Automating alerts and notifications to ensure users are informed about important updates, including policy renewals, claim approvals, and any system updates.
By addressing these core areas, the system will not only streamline operations but also significantly enhance the user experience, making it easier for individuals to manage their health insurance digitally.
